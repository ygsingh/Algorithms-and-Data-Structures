## 1. Maximum Pairwise Product
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers. <br /> 
**Input:** A sequence of non-negative integers. <br />
**Output:** Maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence. <br />
### Sample
**Input:**  <br /> 
```cpp
3
3 4 6
```
**Output:**  <br />
